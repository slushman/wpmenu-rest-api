Adds REST endpoints for menus and menu locations.

== Description ==

Adds REST endpoints for menus and menu locations. There are four endpoints added:

1. /menus - returns all menus.
2. /menus/$id - returns a specific menu with its menu items.
3. /menu-locations - returns all the menu locations.
4. /menu-locations/$slug - returns the menu and menu items assigned to a specific menu location.

The returned menu items are not nested. If you're using the WPMenu React component, it handles nesting while creating the output.

CSS classes for the menu items are returned both as an array and as a string. Your choice.

It also tells CORS to allow GET requests for the menus.



== Installation ==

1. Within the WordPress admin, go to Plugins > Add New
2. Click the "Upload Plugin" button
3. Click the "Choose File" button to select and upload the `wpmenu-rest-api.zip` file.
4. Activate the plugin once its uploaded.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this just the WP API Menus plugin? =

This is a fork of that plugin. I needed some slightly different formatting returned and that plugin is no longer maintained. In addition to the slightly different formatting, I also added support for menu items that are custom items, categories, and taxonomies. I also added unit tests to ensure future changes don't break things. Props to Fulvio Notarstefano @unfulvio.


= Does this plugin support the v1 REST API? =

No. That's not included in core, so there's no reason to support it.


= Why are there two versions of the classes for menu items? =

I prefer to use the npm classnames utility package to help manage class names, so I needed the class names returned as an array. But the original plugin returned everything as a string, so I wanted to offer that as well. There's no reason not to do both, so that's what I did here.


= What about CORS headers? =

This plugin opens up the CORS headers for the menus for GET requests, but nothing else.
