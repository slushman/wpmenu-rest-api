Adds REST endpoints for menus and menu locations.

## Description

Adds REST endpoints for menus and menu locations. There are four endpoints added:

1. /menus - returns all menus.
2. /menus/$id - returns a specific menu with its menu items.
3. /menu-locations - returns all the menu locations.
4. /menu-locations/$slug - returns the menu and menu items assigned to a specific menu location.

The returned menu items are not nested. If you're using the WPMenu React component, it handles nesting while creating the output.

CSS classes for the menu items are returned both as an array and as a string. Your choice.

It also tells CORS to allow GET requests for the menus.
